# Aphex Twin Track Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Aphex Twin's discography using Spotify's audio features. The project focuses on understanding relationships between various track features and developing a custom metric called "Bangerness" to evaluate the intensity and atmosphere of each track. Additionally, it aims to better understand how Spotify's metrics apply to the unique music of Aphex Twin.

## Introduction

This project analyzes Aphex Twin's music using data from Spotify's audio features. The goal is to uncover patterns in the music and develop ways to quantify the emotional and energetic qualities of each track.

## Data Collection

Data on Aphex Twin's tracks was collected using the Spotify API, focusing on features like energy, valence, loudness, and danceability. This dataset forms the basis of the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis includes visualizing relationships between different track features using a correlation heatmap. This helps in identifying interactions between features that could be important for creating custom metrics.

## Custom Metrics

A custom metric called "Bangerness" was developed to evaluate the intensity and atmosphere of each track. This metric considers factors like energy, valence, and loudness, with adjustments based on the track's release date.

## Usage

To explore the analysis, clone this repository and run the provided Jupyter notebooks. This will guide you through the process of analyzing Aphex Twin's music using Spotify's metrics.
